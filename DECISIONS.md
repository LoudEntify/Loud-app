# Overnight product round — decision log

Branch: `feature/overnight-product-round`. Preview only, never merged to main, never deployed to production.

Every judgment call made without you, with a one-line reason. Newest section at the bottom.

---

## 1. Auth-first home + rebrand

- **Live show moved from `/` to `/live`.** The root had to become the auth landing, and the show needed a stable home; `/live` is the obvious name and keeps every existing deep link shape (`/cam`, `/egress`) untouched.
- **Signed-in users skip the landing.** Hitting `/` while authenticated redirects to `/dashboard` (artist) or `/discover` (viewer) rather than showing a login form to someone already logged in.
- **Viewers are gated at `/live`, not at the root.** Gating the route the show actually lives on means a shared show link prompts login and then lands you on the show, instead of dumping you on a generic home page.
- **Rebrand is a literal string swap, not a redesign.** "Neon Meridian" was a placeholder artist name doubling as the wordmark; every instance becomes "Loudentify" and nothing else about the mark changes tonight.

## 2. Signup fields

- **Date of birth, not age.** You asked for age; I collect DOB and derive age. Age is a number that silently goes stale in the database, and anything later that needs an age threshold (13+, 18+ for payouts) needs the birth date anyway. Reversible either way, but only DOB can produce a correct age tomorrow.
- **Username is unique, lowercase, `a-z 0-9 _`, 3–20 chars.** Usernames end up in URLs and mentions; letting mixed case or spaces in now creates a migration later.
- **"Stage name" is a label, not a column.** Artists see "Stage name", fans see "Username", both write to `username`. One namespace means an artist and a fan can never collide, which is what you want the day handles become public.
- **Country via ISO alpha-2 codes + `Intl.DisplayNames`.** Storing the code (not the label) keeps the data stable if display names change, and deriving labels from the browser means no 250-line hardcoded list to maintain.
- **Signup degrades gracefully before the migration runs.** The profile insert tries the full field set and, if the columns don't exist yet, retries with the original ones and logs a warning — so the preview is usable tonight and gets richer the moment you run the SQL.
- **Genres kept optional at signup.** Making a multi-select mandatory on a signup form is the classic way to lose signups; the field is there, skipping it is allowed, and Settings already edits it.

## 3. Placeholder purge

- **Deleted `ArtistProfile.jsx` outright.** `/artist` now renders the signed-in artist's *real* public page through the same component fans see, so an artist is never looking at a flattering mockup of themselves.
- **Stats removed, not zeroed.** Shows-watched, reactions-sent, follower/"signal" counts and view counts are gone rather than showing `0`. Nothing counts them yet, and a `0` claims a measurement that isn't happening — while a wall of zeros reads as a dead platform.
- **Top supporters → empty state.** Invented revenue is the fastest way to make an artist distrust every other number on the page.
- **Messages → honest empty state.** There is no threads table, no delivery, no recipients. A fake inbox is worse than an empty one because it invites a reply to someone who doesn't exist.
- **Archived VOD chat → empty.** Live comments aren't persisted anywhere, so there is genuinely nothing to replay.
- **Discover is real.** Artists come from `profiles` where `role='artist'`; live shows from `shows` in soundcheck past their slated time. Genre filter chips are built from genres real artists actually have, so the filter can never offer a genre nobody performs.
- **`select('*')` for shows.** `title`/`performance_mode` only arrive with the scheduling migration; naming them in the query would 400 the whole thing beforehand, so Discover reads defensively and works before and after.

## 4. Scheduling + broadcast window

- **Kit Check is a separate route (`/kit-check`), not a mode inside the live page.** This is what makes "zero LiveKit connection" *provable* rather than asserted — there is no `LiveKitRoom` anywhere in that component tree, so it cannot connect by accident.
- **Camera ownership is inverted where it matters.** Kit Check acquires the camera with its own `getUserMedia`, attaches it to an element it owns, flips it, stops it and releases it. No LiveKit lifecycle is involved at all. The *live* path still lets LiveKitRoom own the camera — see "what I did not do" in the summary.
- **The window opens 30 minutes before showtime** and closes 3 hours after, unless the artist ends the show. A window that never shuts is a LiveKit bill that never stops. 30 minutes reuses the existing soundcheck constant rather than inventing a second "how early can I start" number.
- **GO LIVE is disabled, not hidden, before the window.** A greyed button that says when it unlocks teaches the rule; a missing button just looks broken.
- **Reminders are generated lazily by the artist's own session, not by a job.** There is no cron in this stack. The honest consequence: a reminder appears the next time you open Loudentify after it comes due, not at the exact minute. A unique `dedupe_key` makes running the check on every page load harmless.
- **Push and email are NOT wired.** Both need infrastructure (a service worker + VAPID keys, or an email provider) that isn't trivially achievable in one night. Logged as follow-up; in-app entries are real.
- **The countdown overlay doesn't block.** 50% opacity and `pointer-events: none`, so the artist can still see and fix their framing during the final 60 seconds — which is exactly when they'd want to.
- **Kit Check releases the camera and mic before handing over to the live page.** Two owners of one device is how you get a black frame on stage.
- **More fake stats found and removed** while wiring this in: FOLLOWERS 84.2K, TOKENS EARNED 312K, SIGNAL 8,420 on the dashboard.

## 5. B-roll

- **Clips live in the existing recordings bucket under `broll/`.** No second bucket and no second access model to keep in sync — B-roll inherits the private-bucket + signed-URL posture recordings already have.
- **Owner-only, no public visibility flag.** B-roll is working material, not published content.
- **Caps are shown before the picker, not after the upload.** 100MB/clip, 500MB/artist, with a quota bar that turns orange past 80% so the ceiling is visible before it blocks anything.
- **A failed row insert deletes the uploaded object.** Storage and the table can never disagree about what exists.
- **Live playback into the broadcast is NOT built** — see the summary. Upload, manage, delete and quota are real.

## 6. Recordings grid

- **Poster frames come from the real file** — a muted `<video>` seeked ~1s in via a media fragment — so there is no separate thumbnail pipeline to build, store or invalidate.
- **Signed URLs are fetched sequentially.** A handful of recordings; firing N signing requests at once buys nothing on an already-rendered page.

## 7. Share + clip range

- **Sharing requires public, and the toggle is on the share page.** A share link to a private recording dead-ends for everyone it's sent to; making them go back to the dashboard to fix that is a trap.
- **`/watch/[id]` is a server component** so `generateMetadata` produces real preview cards. It reads under RLS, so a private recording can't leak its title through an unfurl.
- **Instagram is a copy-link button that says so.** Instagram has no web share endpoint; any "share to Instagram" button on the web is a copy-link button in costume.
- **Clip export is visibly not switched on.** The range picker is real and wired; the export needs a background job runner this stack doesn't have. A button that appears to work and silently does nothing is worse than an honest note.

## 8. Wallet

- **Balance is summed from the ledger, never stored.** A stored balance and a ledger can disagree, and when they do the artist is looking at a number nobody can reconstruct.
- **There is no insert policy on `wallet_transactions`.** Nothing client-side can credit a balance. Real money movement will write through a service-role route.
- **Purchase tiers with dollar prices removed.** A price tag that can't be paid invites a fan to try and hit nothing.

## 9. Sign-out + account reset (morning follow-up)

- **`signOut()` existed but was never called from any UI.** That is the whole reason a session was a one-way door. `AuthButton` is the missing call site, placed on `/profile` and `/artist`.
- **Sign-out redirects even if the server call fails.** A session that can't be revoked remotely — deleted user, expired token, no connection — must still let you out locally. Being stuck signed in as an account that no longer exists is exactly the trap being fixed.
- **Sign-out clears the legacy `loudentify:accountType` flag.** Sidebar and AccountSettings still read it; leaving it behind means the nav keeps insisting you're an artist after you've logged out.
- **Account deletion is a script you run, not something I execute.** Same pattern as every other migration here, and it keeps an irreversible action under your hand. It's transaction-wrapped with a `rollback` you flip to `commit`.
- **Three foreign keys had to be detached first.** `shows.artist_id`, `show_slots.claimed_by_user_id` and `cue_sheets.artist_id` reference `auth.users` *without* cascade, so a plain delete fails with a FK violation. The script nulls them first.
- **Storage files are not deleted by the SQL.** Deleting a row doesn't delete the object it points at; recordings, B-roll and avatars would be left orphaned in the bucket. Called out as an explicit step rather than left as a surprise.

## 10. Performer codes retired (post-wipe access ruling)

- **Solo needs no code, anywhere.** Logged in + owns the show + inside the window is the whole check. The code field is gone from the live path, not just bypassed.
- **Versus slot B is a single-use invite link**, bound to whoever accepts it while logged in. Re-minting an invite replaces the token, which *is* the revoke — no separate revoke endpoint to forget about.
- **The window is enforced server-side in `join-show`, not just by the button.** A disabled button is a courtesy; the API is the rule, and it's what keeps LiveKit unbillable outside a scheduled show.
- **Already-bound accounts get straight back in, with no token.** That single branch is both "the opponent refreshes after accepting" and Round D's resume-your-slot: after acceptance the invite is consumed, so every later join is recognised by *account*. Session tokens still rotate per join, now keyed to (account, scheduled show).
- **Slot rows are created on demand, not at schedule time.** `join-show` upserts slot A when the owner goes live; the invite route upserts slot B when they invite. Fewer rows that can drift out of sync with a show that gets deleted.
- **Invite lookup is readable logged-out; accepting is not.** You should be able to see who's asking and to what before deciding to make an account. It exposes only what the sender already chose to share.
- **Invalid, already-accepted and re-minted invites all return the same message.** Distinguishing them would let someone probe which tokens ever existed.
- **`claim-slot` is deprecated in place, not deleted.** Pre-ruling rows still carry codes; deleting the only path that understands them would strand a legacy show mid-flight.

### Camfeed decision (item 4)

- **Extra cameras pair as DEVICES, not people — short-lived code from the artist's dashboard.** A phone taped to a mic stand has no account and shouldn't need one. `camfeed_pairings` (in the migration) is scoped to one show + one slot with an expiry, service-role only, zero RLS policies — a pairing code that the anon key can read stops meaning anything.
- **This is deliberately a different job from the retired performer code.** That code proved *who you were*, which is exactly why it had to go. This proves only that the device was handed a code by someone who could already see the artist's dashboard — a much weaker claim, which is all a camera needs to make.
- **Table and rationale are shipped; the pairing exchange endpoint and QR panel rewiring are not.** Camfeeds still join through the existing `/api/token?camfeed=` path tonight. Flagged as the next piece rather than half-built.

## 11. Profile/dashboard consolidation + role fluidity

- **`/artist/[id]` is the one profile route; the owner sees the console there.** "Dashboard" is gone as a destination. `/dashboard`, `/profile` and `/artist` all resolve through one helper so there is exactly one answer to "where do I live", whichever link got you there.
- **Enforcement is the database, not `isOwner`.** `isOwner` decides what to *render*. What keeps private data private is RLS: `broll_clips`, `wallet_transactions` and `notifications` are select-own; `recordings` returns own-rows-or-public. A visitor's client cannot fetch the private rows at all — nothing arrives and then gets hidden.
- **`shows` is the deliberate exception.** Its RLS is open, and upcoming shows are public information in both modes anyway. Flagged rather than silently relied on.
- **`RecordingsLibrary` takes an `owner` prop but doesn't filter on it.** The query is identical in both modes; RLS decides what comes back. Filtering client-side would have implied the security lived here.
- **The header is the same component in both modes.** An artist should always be looking at the page their audience sees, not a flattering variant of it.
- **Follow is disabled with a reason, not hidden.** There's no follows table. A button that silently does nothing is worse than one that admits it isn't built.
- **The sidebar stopped reading the legacy `accountType` flag.** It pointed PROFILE at `/dashboard` or `/profile` based on localStorage; now both resolve correctly, so it just points at `/profile` and the mock dependency is gone from the nav.
- **Deleted `ArtistDashboard.jsx` and `MyArtistProfile.jsx`.** Both were fully superseded; leaving them invites someone to edit the wrong file.
- **Upgrade goes through a server route, not a client profile update.** `profiles_update_own` would technically permit a browser to flip its own `role`. Routing it through `/api/profile/become-artist` creates one place to add terms acceptance, age thresholds or verification before that matters — rather than discovering later that role is self-serve from a console.
- **Added `verifySession` alongside `verifyArtistAuth`.** The upgrade request is by definition made by someone who is *not yet* an artist, so the artist check would 403 the very request meant to make them one. Kept in the same file so nobody reaches for the wrong one.
- **Upgrade is one-way.** Downgrade raises questions this round doesn't answer — scheduled shows, public recordings, an invited opponent mid-flight — and a half-answered downgrade is worse than none.
- **The handle does not change on upgrade.** Both roles already share one username namespace, so there is nothing to claim; the stage name is the display name, which is separate and non-unique.
- **After upgrading you land on your new console**, not back on settings — landing on settings hides the thing that just changed.
